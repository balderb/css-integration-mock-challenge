In this exercise you will build three full integrations.
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

Create a standard style.css stylesheet
Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks exactly as the provided high-fidelity mockup images.
