css-integration-mock-challenge trial exam becode

In this exercise you will build three full integrations.
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface we have to:

Create a standard html page based on the html5boilerplate <br>
Create a standard style.css stylesheet <br>
Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks exactly as the provided high-fidelity mockup images. <br>
With other words, make it look pixel perfect. Use only HTML & CSS (SCSS).


# add clickable link per interface: 
Interface 1<br>
interface 2<br>
interface 3<br>
